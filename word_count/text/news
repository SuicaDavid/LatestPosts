The New York Times alleges that Donald Trump paid just $750 (Â£587) in federal income tax in 2016, the year he won the US presidency.
The newspaper - which says it has obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades - also says he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the last 15 years.
It says this is "largely" due to the companies reporting losses.
Mr Trump dismissed the report as "totally fake news".
"Actually I paid, but you'll see then as soon as my tax returns are done," he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday.
The New York Times said it had reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and the companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017.

The publication claims that President Trump paid just $750 in income taxes in 2016, and $750 in 2017.
The Trump Organization also rejected the allegations.
Alan Garten, chief legal officer of the Trump Organization, said that "most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate", in response to a letter compiling the Times' findings.
